# LargestArea
Mr. Ross is driving his car on a sunny morning, when he sees a Advertisement 
Board saying Rs10000 per sq. ft. of land. Ross gets surprised at this unusual
 pricing as the standard price is no less than Rs15000 per sq. ft. of land. 
He calls up the agent and speaks with him. The agent says that there is a land full 
of 1’s and 0’s in a hilly area, which can be used for farming. But, only the 1’s are
 available at Rs10000, whereas the 0’s are available at the standard price.
 Mr. Ross is really eager to buy a large chunk of land. Can you help him find out 
the largest area of 1’s present in the field of NxM dimensions?
 Note: Mr. Ross wants the land so much that he does not care about its shape.
